# Wallet Integration for MOMOMUhub

This document explains the wallet integration added to the MEMOMU game, supporting both MetaMask and WalletConnect.

## Features

### üîó Multi-Wallet Support
- **Wallet Selection Modal**: Click WALLET button to choose between MetaMask and WalletConnect
- **MetaMask Integration**: Direct connection to MetaMask using `window.ethereum`
- **WalletConnect Integration**: Support for WalletConnect-compatible wallets
- **Connection Status**: Visual indicator showing wallet connection state with provider icons
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling for users without wallets installed

### üèÜ Enhanced Leaderboard
- **Wallet Address Display**: Shows connected wallet address next to player names
- **Provider Icons**: ü¶ä for MetaMask, üîó for WalletConnect connections
- **Blockchain Verification**: Players with connected wallets have their addresses stored with scores
- **Backwards Compatibility**: Players without connected wallets still appear normally on leaderboard

### üéÆ User Experience
- **Non-Intrusive**: Players can play normally without connecting a wallet
- **Optional Feature**: Wallet connection is completely optional
- **Persistent State**: Wallet connection persists across game sessions
- **Already Connected**: Shows current connection status if wallet already connected

## Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
let walletConnection = {
  isConnected: false,    // Connection status
  address: null,         // User's wallet address
  provider: null,        // Wallet provider object
  providerType: null     // 'metamask' or 'walletconnect'
};
```

### Connection Flow
1. User clicks "WALLET" button
2. Modal displays wallet options: MetaMask and WalletConnect
3. User selects preferred wallet provider
4. System attempts connection to chosen provider
5. On success, stores wallet address and sets up event listeners
6. Updates UI to show connection status with provider icon

### Wallet Selection Modal
- Clean modal interface with provider options
- MetaMask option with ü¶ä icon
- WalletConnect option with üîó icon
- Cancel option to close modal
- Styled with game theme colors

### Provider Support
- **MetaMask**: Full integration with window.ethereum
- **WalletConnect**: Ready for integration with WalletConnect library
- **Auto-detection**: Checks for provider availability
- **Fallback handling**: Graceful degradation when providers unavailable

### Error Handling
- **No MetaMask**: Shows informative message, allows continued play
- **No WalletConnect**: Shows availability message
- **User Rejection**: Handles rejection gracefully, no interruption to gameplay
- **Network Errors**: Provides fallback behavior

## Browser Compatibility

- **Required**: Modern browsers with JavaScript support
- **MetaMask**: Optional - enhances experience but not required
- **WalletConnect**: Compatible with various mobile and desktop wallets
- **Mobile**: Compatible with MetaMask mobile app and WalletConnect-enabled wallets

## Security Considerations

- **No Private Keys**: Only uses wallet addresses for display
- **No Transactions**: Does not initiate any blockchain transactions
- **Read-Only**: Only reads wallet address, no write operations
- **Local Storage**: Wallet addresses stored only in browser localStorage

## Future Enhancements

Potential future additions could include:
- Full WalletConnect v2 integration with project ID
- NFT integration for special achievements
- On-chain score verification
- Blockchain-based tournaments
- Web3 social features
- Additional wallet providers (Coinbase, Trust Wallet, etc.)

## Usage

1. **Install Wallet**: Download MetaMask from [metamask.io](https://metamask.io) or use WalletConnect-compatible wallet
2. **Connect Wallet**: Click "WALLET" button in game
3. **Choose Provider**: Select MetaMask or WalletConnect from modal
4. **Authorize Connection**: Follow wallet prompts to connect
5. **Play Games**: Achieve high scores while connected
6. **View Leaderboard**: See your wallet address and provider icon next to your name

The integration is designed to be lightweight and optional, ensuring the game remains accessible to all players regardless of their blockchain experience while providing enhanced features for Web3 users.
